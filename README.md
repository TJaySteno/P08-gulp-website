## Project 8
### Build a Website Using Gulp

This project uses Gulp to streamline development of a website. It takes Sass files, converts them to CSS. It then concatenates all CSS files and JS files into two files, one for each language, then minimizes those files. Finally, it places all the converted source files into a separate 'dist' folder and creates a server that watches for changes to the Sass files.

*__Skills:__ Gulp, Node.js, npm*
