## Project 8
### Using Gulp to Build a Front End Website

This project uses Gulp to streamline development of a website. It first takes Sass files and converts them to CSS. It then concatenates all CSS files into a single file, minimizes it, and creates a map to the source files. This process is repeated for the JavaScript as well. Finally, it places all the converted source files into a separate 'dist' folder and watches for changes to the source Sass files, ready to restart the server with the new styles.

__Grader's Overall Comments:__ "Excellent work! Your Using Gulp to Build a Front End Website project is awesome. You clearly know your way around Gulp and creating some good workflow automation. Your tasks are in order and look good and run well with the proper commands. Your Gulp file looks clean and well organized, as does your directory. You’ve got your .gitignore file in place, so the node-modules folder isn’t being tracked. That’s awesome. Fantastic work all around!

"As you move on to your next project, keep up the great work! And keep shooting for those exceeds grades! The time spent attempting to hit those exceeds criteria will strengthen your skills and give you cooler projects to show off at the end of this Techdegree.

"Your next project is all about building on the skills you’ve already developed and integrating a JS framework into the mix. This one will be a lot of fun, but it can be a bit daunting as well. Though I know you will do great! :)

"Good luck and happy coding as you move forward! You rock! :)"
